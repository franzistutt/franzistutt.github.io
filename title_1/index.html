		    In this assignment the main idea is to generate cubes using nested loops. After setting up the envirnment, the GUI slider is integrated to the project in order to change the size, the scale, the amount of cubes and make the rotation more flexible.The function “Matrix” achieves a change in size, scale, number of cubes and rotation through the nested loops. The first loop changes the quantity of the cubes in Y direction. The second loop in X direction an the last loop in Z direction. After the cubes are generated flexible, depending on their in size and scale factor they get translated in relation to their size. The parameter rotation rotates the created geometry around the Y axis, depending on the distance between the cube and the axis. Additionally the cubes are able to rotate around their own center vector, through a second rotation parameter.
