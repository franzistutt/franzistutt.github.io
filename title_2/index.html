			In the second assignment the goal was to generate a variety of trees using a recursive function called “system”. The generated geometry is based on a ruleset of symbols, set in the function “generate”.Based on the symbols the function “draw system”, translates the symbols in order to draw the branches of the tree. In the same function the apples are created depending on their location. The integrated GUI slider enable a change in size, height, and number ob trees in X and Y direction to create a structured but pre designed landscape of trees. Using the function “update landscape”, the tree size is generated adaptable, depending on the number of recursions. Using a nested loop inside this function the amount of trees is set flexible in the generated landscape. By changing the parameter height, the length of each line of the tree is extend. Additionally the look of the trees is defined by the different angles of their branche in relation to the position. This enables the user to design a landscape with a variety of different trees as the outcome.

			    Use the sliders to change the size and height by typing in a number. the numer of trees are changed using the parameters x and y by moving the slider.
